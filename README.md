# 📊 **Media Ads Performance Analysis — Facebook, Google & LinkedIn**

This project analyzes digital advertising performance across **three major platforms** — **Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn** — using **Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL**.
Each platform has its **own dataset**, and **a separate dashboard** is created in every tool to provide clear, actionable insights.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

Many businesses run ads across multiple social media platforms, but comparing performance becomes difficult due to inconsistent metrics and formats.
This project solves that by performing **data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and SQL-based validation** across all three datasets.
